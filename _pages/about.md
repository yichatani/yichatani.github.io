About me
------
I am pursuing a Master's degree in [Schools of EEE](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/eee) from [Nanyang Technological University](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/) and I already have a Bachelor's degree in [Schools of Optoelectronics](http://opt.zju.edu.cn/) from [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/). My research interests are in robotics, focusing on robotic grasping. I am one of the members of the Grasp Lab at Zhejiang University where I have gained lots of knowledge and experience in robotics. Now, I am an intern at ASTAR ARM to study robotics further.
