I am pursuing a Master's degree in [Schools of EEE](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/eee) from [Nanyang Technological University](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/) and I already have a Bachelor's degree in [Schools of Optoelectronics](http://opt.zju.edu.cn/) from [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/). My research interests are in robotics, focusing on robotic grasping. I am one of the members of the [Grasp Lab](https://grasplab2022.github.io/) at Zhejiang University where I have gained lots of knowledge and experience in robotics. Now, I am an intern at [ASTAR](https://www.a-star.edu.sg/) [SIMTech ARM](https://www.a-star.edu.sg/simtech/research/adaptive-robotics-and-mechatronics-(arm)) to study robotics further. 

Here is my [CV](../assets/CV.pdf).
